Heey! This one was solved by ✨magic✨

--- Part Two ---

The Elves thank you profusely for the help and start rearranging the oddly-shaped presents. As you look up, you notice that a lot more Elves have arrived here at the Christmas tree farm.

In fact, many of these new arrivals look familiar: they're the Elves you helped while decorating the North Pole base. Right on schedule, each group seems to have brought a star to put atop one of the Christmas trees!

Before any of them can find a ladder, a particularly large Christmas tree suddenly flashes brightly when a large star magically appears above it! As your eyes readjust, you think you notice a portly man with a white beard disappear into the crowd.

You go look for a ladder; only 23 stars to go.
