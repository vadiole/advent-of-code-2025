# Advent of code 2025
This is my first fully solved year!<br>
The problems were reasonably interesting, and some were quite hard.<br>

Yeah I did use a solver for day 10 part 2, but it still was a challenge to connect all the pieces.

This year I learned more about:<br>
– Coordinate compression<br>
– AABB Collision Detection<br>
– OR-Tools for solving LP problem<br>
– The beauty of splitting beams<br>
